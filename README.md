# day-planner
JS day planner

This assignment went quicker than I thought.

I essentially had a grab locale storage function, a check current time function, and a onclick event for the save buttons

For locale storage I used the id of the time block

The numbered id really helped (each id is that hour of day converted to military time)

var currentHour = moment().toObject().hours

I used moment current hour.

I have a screen shot but don't know how to add a picture to this readme
